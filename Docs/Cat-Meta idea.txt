Yes, you can use multiple models in a Django FormView. In Django, FormViews are designed to handle form submissions and interact with one specific form class. However, it doesn't restrict you from working with multiple models within the same view.

To work with multiple models in a FormView, you have a few options:

Use a single form class that includes fields from multiple models:

Create a custom form class that includes fields from multiple models.
Override the get_context_data method in your FormView to pass the necessary data to the template.
Override the form_valid method to handle the form submission and save the data to the appropriate models.
Use multiple form classes:

Create separate form classes for each model you want to work with.
Override the get_context_data method in your FormView to pass instances of each form class to the template.
Override the form_valid method to handle the form submissions separately for each form class.
Here's a basic example using multiple form classes:


#------------------------------------------------------------------------


python
Copy code
from django.views.generic.edit import FormView
from .forms import CategoryForm, MetaTagsForm

class MyFormView(FormView):
    template_name = 'my_template.html'
    form_class = CategoryForm
    second_form_class = MetaTagsForm

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        context['second_form'] = self.second_form_class()
        return context

    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Handle submission for the first form class
        category_form = form.save()

        # Handle submission for the second form class
        second_form = self.second_form_class(self.request.POST)
        if second_form.is_valid():
            meta_tags = second_form.save(commit=False)
            # associate meta_tags with category_form if needed
            meta_tags.save()

        # Redirect or return a response
        return super().form_valid(form)


#------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the example above, MyFormView uses two form classes: CategoryForm and MetaTagsForm. The get_context_data method adds an instance of the MetaTagsForm to the context, which can be accessed in the template. The form_valid method handles the form submissions for both form classes separately.

Remember to update the form classes (CategoryForm and MetaTagsForm) according to your model requirements and fields.

By using this approach, you can work with multiple models and their associated forms in a single FormView.
